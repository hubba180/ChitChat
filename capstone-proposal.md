##### Description
Inspired by functionality of an application like Discord, I’d like to test my skills and recreate the site, but not so tailored towards gaming. I think an application that can integrate useful classroom services such as note taking and profile building while still maintaining the fluid functionality of Discord could be very useful in today’s age of online learning. 

##### Use Case
In our global world, many companies search for an efficient way to collaborate with members a world away. Many apps like Zoom or Skype, have attempted to fix that problem, each attaining a solid degree of success. Discord builds off that foundation and is today, by my opinion, an example of the best environment in an online collaboration site. The goal of my project is to A) get a good grasp of integrating video chat, voice chat, and screen sharing technology, B) create a fluid and customizable UI based on the functionality seen in Discord, C) integrate useful online learning tools 

##### Minimum Viable Product
(List the absolute minimum features the project requires before it is considered in a pre-alpha state)
 * As a user I can start a video chat room with another computer
 * As a user I can start a text chat with another user
 * As a user I can chat with multiple users at once
 * As a user I can create a profile with online learning resources
 * As a user I can create subject related server
 ##### Stretch Goals
 * As a user I can sign up my user profile to attend that server/ restrict to outside viewers
 * As a user I can share my screen
 * multiple users can share a screen at once
 * As a user I can customize app ui to my own taste via color, panel organization, or hiding features

##### Tools for MVP
(List the tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules, resources, languages, etc that will be used to create your MVP. Be specific.)

##### Additional Features
(If you finish developing your MVP and have time to spare, what features do you want to work on next? Be specific.)
 * Integrate video and text chat, similar to google meet format
 * allow users to create restricted servers for private conversations
 * integrate a notepad

##### Tools for Additional Features
