**ABOUT**

ChitChat is an instant messaging desktop application that allows user to collaborate in real time. 

</p>


## **âœ…REQUIREMENTS**

* Install [Git v2.62.2+](https://git-scm.com/downloads/)
* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## **Description of Structure**
  Users first come into a sign in landing page where they can choose to either log in or create a new profile. After that, the application redirects to a site control page which consists of several components: a header navigational component, a multifunctional utility screen showing chats and homefeed, and a utility bar which houses all current contacts. From here, a user may easily respond to, review, and initiate real time conversations through their contacts list. To initiate a new chat, view an old chat, or continue an ongoing conversation, simply select the desired contact in the utility bar to bring up the chat component in the utility screen.
